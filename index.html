          <p>
            Joanne Rowling was born on 31st July 1965 at Yate General Hospital
            near Bristol, and grew up in Gloucestershire in England and in
            Chepstow, Gwent, in south-east Wales.
          </p>

          <p>
            Her father, Peter, was an aircraft engineer at the Rolls Royce
            factory in Bristol and her mother, Anne, was a science technician in
            the Chemistry department at Wyedean Comprehensive, where Jo herself
            went to school. Anne was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when Jo
            was a teenager and died in 1990, before the Harry Potter books were
            published. Jo also has a younger sister, Di.
          </p>

          <p>
            The young Jo grew up surrounded by books. “I lived for books,’’ she
            has said. “I was your basic common-or-garden bookworm, complete with
            freckles and National Health spectacles.”
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content2">
          <p>
            Jo wanted to be a writer from an early age. She wrote her first book
            at the age of six – a story about a rabbit, called ‘Rabbit’. At just
            eleven, she wrote her first novel – about seven cursed diamonds and
            the people who owned them.
          </p>

          <p>
            Jo studied at Exeter University, where she read so widely outside
            her French and Classics syllabus that she clocked up a fine of £50
            for overdue books at the University library. Her knowledge of
            Classics would one day come in handy for creating the spells in the
            Harry Potter series, some of which are based on Latin.
          </p>

          <p>
            Her course included a year in Paris. “I lived in Paris for a year as
            a student,” Jo tweeted after the 2015 terrorist attacks there. “It’s
            one of my favourite places on earth.”
          </p>

          <p>
            After her degree, she moved to London and worked in a series of
            jobs, including one as a researcher at Amnesty International. “There
            in my little office I read hastily scribbled letters smuggled out of
            totalitarian regimes by men and women who were risking imprisonment
            to inform the outside world of what was happening to them.” She said
            later. “My small participation in that process was one of the most
            humbling and inspiring experiences of my life.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Jo conceived the idea of Harry Potter in 1990 while sitting on a
            delayed train from Manchester to London King’s Cross. Over the next
            five years, she began to map out all seven books of the series. She
            wrote mostly in longhand and gradually built up a mass of notes,
            many of which were scribbled on odd scraps of paper.
